### Manual Module Installation

In rare cases, you may need to install a module by manually transferring the files onto the server. This is recommended only when absolutely necessary, for example when your server is not configured to allow automatic installations.

This procedure requires you to be familiar with the process of transferring files using an SFTP client. It is recommended for advanced users and developers.

Detailed instruction can be found on official PrestaShop [site](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/content/13-installing-modules)

1. Enter the api key, api url, instructions for your customers, and that all.
    * Instruction â€“ Contains the explanation on how to pay by SHKeeper.
    * Api key - Authorization and identification SHKeeper key. You can generate it in SHKeeper admin panel for any crypto wallet.
    * Api url - SHKeeper server api entry point.
2. Once done save the changes.

## You are done!
